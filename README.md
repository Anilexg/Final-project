# **OCCUPATIONAL** DISEASES ANALYSIS

### _Details_

Created by: Lina Gegužienė and Renata Šimkevičienė

This is the end project of Data analysis course at Vilnius Coding School.

Project theme:  Occupational Diseases data analysis and visualization

The main goal of the project is to find out the number of cases per year, the geographical distribution and which sexes are most affected by Occupational Diseases. The analysis period is from 2005 to 2023.

In this project we used Python, CSV files, and a PostgreSQL database showcasing our practical coding skills acquired at Vilnius Coding School.
  

### _Applied knowledge:_

Used libraries: Pandas, Numpy, MatplotLib, SeaBorn, Selenium,SciPy

##### _postgres_.py

Used database adapter: psycopg2

##### _web_scrap_.py

Getting data from URL ("https://get.data.gov.lt/datasets/gov/hi/profesines/Asmuo").

##### final_project.py

This is the main project file where all analysis were made.

Steps:

1. 

2. All visuals are controlled by functions (def), which helps to separate all graphs in the code.

For example, if you call def "pagal_savivaldybes():" you will receive this view:

![pagal_savivaldybes_2022.png](Pictures%2Fpagal_savivaldybes_2022.png)

For example if you call def "profesiniu_lig_daz(year):" you will receive this view:

![profesines_lig_pagal_priez.png](Pictures%2Fprofesines_lig_pagal_priez.png)

For example if you call def "lytis():" you will receive this view:

![lytis_linijinis.png](Pictures%2Flytis_linijinis.png)

For example if you call def "kitimas_metais():" you will receive this view:

![pokytis.png](Pictures%2Fpokytis.png)

For example if you call def "regresija():" you will receive this view:

![ regresija.png](Pictures%2F%20regresija.png)
